Nerds like us are allowed to be unironically enthusiastic about stuff. Nerds are allowed to love stuff - like, jump-up-and-down-in-your-chair-can't-control-yourself love it. When people call other people nerds, mostly what they're saying is "You like stuff", which is not a good insult at all. Like, "You are too enthusiastic about the miracle of human consciousness".
